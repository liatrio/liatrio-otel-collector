The azuredevops receiver receives data from [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/). It scrapes
projects and repositories in Azure DevOps for:

- **VCS metrics:** repositories, branches, pull requests, and code coverage
- **Deployment metrics:** deployment frequency, duration, and status from Release Management API
- **Work item metrics:** cycle time, age, and counts for tracking work items (User Stories, Bugs, etc.)

The current default set of metrics can be found in
[documentation.md](./documentation.md).

These metrics can be used as leading indicators ([capabilities][doracap])
to the [DORA][dorafour] metrics; helping provide insight into modern-day
engineering practices.

[doracap]: https://dora.dev/capabilities/
[dorafour]: https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/

It also accepts pipeline, stage, and job webhook events from Azure DevOps and emits
traces based on the events.

## Getting Started

The collection interval is common to all scrapers and is set to 30 seconds by default.

> Note: Generally speaking, if the vendor allows for anonymous API calls, then you
> won't have to configure any authentication, but you may only see public repositories
> and organizations. You may run into significantly more rate limiting.

```yaml
azuredevops:
    initial_delay: <duration>
    collection_interval: <duration> #default = 30s recommended 300s
    scrapers:
        azuredevops:
        ...
```

A more complete example using the azuredevops scrapers with authentication is as follows:

```yaml
extensions:
    bearertokenauth/azuredevops:
        token: ${env:ADO_PAT}

receivers:
    azuredevops:
        initial_delay: 1s
        collection_interval: 60s
        scrapers:
            azuredevops:
                metrics:
                    vcs.repository.contributor.count:
                        enabled: true
                organization: myfancyorg
                project: myproject
                limit_pull_requests: 30 #Limit querying merged PRs to the last 30 days
                base_url: "https://dev.azure.com"
                
                # Optional: Deployment metrics configuration
                deployment_pipeline_name: "My Release Pipeline"
                deployment_stage_name: "Production"
                deployment_lookback_days: 30
                
                # Optional: Work item metrics configuration
                work_item_types:
                  - "User Story"
                  - "Bug"
                work_item_lookback_days: 30
                
                auth:
                    authenticator: bearertokenauth/azuredevops
service:
    extensions: [bearertokenauth/azuredevops]
    pipelines:
        metrics:
            receivers: [..., azuredevops]
            processors: []
            exporters: [...]
```

### Deployment Metrics

To enable deployment metrics scraping from Azure DevOps Release Management API, configure the following parameters:

- `deployment_pipeline_name`: Name of the Release Pipeline to scrape (optional - if not set, deployment metrics are disabled)
- `deployment_stage_name`: Name of the Environment/Stage to track (optional - if not set, deployment metrics are disabled)
- `deployment_lookback_days`: Number of days of deployment history to fetch on first scrape (optional, default: 30)

**Note:** Both `deployment_pipeline_name` and `deployment_stage_name` must be set to enable deployment metrics. If either is empty, deployment scraping is skipped.

**Note:** Your Azure DevOps PAT must have **Release (Read)** permissions in addition to **Code (Read)** to scrape deployment metrics.

### Work Item Metrics

To enable work item metrics scraping from Azure DevOps Work Items API, configure the following parameters:

- `work_item_types`: Array of work item types to track (e.g., "User Story", "Bug", "Task") (optional - if not set or empty, work item metrics are disabled)
- `work_item_lookback_days`: Number of days of work item history to fetch on first scrape (optional, default: 30)

Work item metrics include:
- **Cycle Time**: Time from creation to closure for completed work items
- **Age**: Time since creation for open work items
- **Count**: Number of work items by type and state

**Note:** Your Azure DevOps PAT must have **Work Items (Read)** permissions in addition to **Code (Read)** to scrape work item metrics.

A Grafana Dashboard exists on the marketplace for metrics from this receiver
and can be found
[here](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20976-engineering-effectiveness-metrics/).

## Scraping

> Important:
> * The azuredevops scraper does not emit metrics for refs that have not had
>   changes since creation from the default ref (trunk).
> * Due to Azure DevOps API limitations, it is possible for the ref time metric to
>   change when rebases occur, recreating the commits with new timestamps.
