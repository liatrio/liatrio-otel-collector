The azuredevops receiver receives data from [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/). It scrapes
projects and repositories in Azure DevOps for metrics related to branches and pull requests.

The current default set of metrics can be found in
[documentation.md](./documentation.md).

These metrics can be used as leading indicators ([capabilities][doracap])
to the [DORA][dorafour] metrics; helping provide insight into modern-day
engineering practices.

[doracap]: https://dora.dev/capabilities/
[dorafour]: https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/

It also accepts pipeline, stage, and job webhook events from Azure DevOps and emits
traces based on the events.

## Getting Started

The collection interval is common to all scrapers and is set to 30 seconds by default.

> Note: Generally speaking, if the vendor allows for anonymous API calls, then you
> won't have to configure any authentication, but you may only see public repositories
> and organizations. You may run into significantly more rate limiting.

```yaml
azuredevops:
    initial_delay: <duration>
    collection_interval: <duration> #default = 30s recommended 300s
    scrapers:
        azuredevops:
        ...
```

A more complete example using the azuredevops scrapers with authentication is as follows:

```yaml
extensions:
    bearertokenauth/azuredevops:
        token: ${env:ADO_PAT}

receivers:
    azuredevops:
        initial_delay: 1s
        collection_interval: 60s
        scrapers:
            azuredevops:
                metrics:
                    vcs.repository.contributor.count:
                        enabled: true
                organization: myfancyorg
                limit_merge_requests: 30 #Limit querying merged MRs to the last 30 days, defaults to querying all historical merged MRs
                base_url: "https://selfmanagedenterpriseserver.com"
                auth:
                    authenticator: bearertokenauth/azuredevops
service:
    extensions: [bearertokenauth/azuredevops]
    pipelines:
        metrics:
            receivers: [..., azuredevops]
            processors: []
            exporters: [...]
```

A Grafana Dashboard exists on the marketplace for metrics from this receiver
and can be found
[here](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20976-engineering-effectiveness-metrics/).

## Scraping

> Important:
> * The azuredevops scraper does not emit metrics for refs that have not had
>   changes since creation from the default ref (trunk).
> * Due to Azure DevOps API limitations, it is possible for the ref time metric to
>   change when rebases occur, recreating the commits with new timestamps.
