# Contributing to liatrio-otel-collector

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Coding Conventions, e.g., PEP8], So Pull Requests Need To Pass This.

TODO: Include information about the coding style guide or conventions that you use. If there are any tools that they should use or any checks that their code needs to pass, detail them here.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the [Software License]

Explain that when someone submits a contribution, they are agreeing that the project owner can use their contribution under the project's license.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/liatrio/liatrio-otel-collector/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

TODO: Detail the style guide and coding conventions further, if needed.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its [License Name].

## References

Include any references or resources that might be helpful for the contributor.
